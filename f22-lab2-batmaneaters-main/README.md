# F22-lab2: Audio in! Let's Party! 
Programmer: Ruobing Wang (ruobing2) Xingzhi Wang (xingzhi2)
## Implementation
In this lab, we implement GPIO, RTT, ADC, I2C PWM and integrate them all togehter to achieve the result that by inputting start signal to RTT the light sensor (I2C) will check the surrounding luminum, it is dark enough, the light will be on! And using ADC, we can pass the audio and visulizer will process the data and pass to PWM and set the RGB color. And low frequency will be red, then green and the high frequency will be blue.


### Bonus
Instead of integrating these functions together for achieving the result, we treat them as APIs. And our Neopixel output has no slowdown to the RTT print statements. We will also show this in the demo!

## Demos:
We present two videos for demo! Enjoy!

## Thanks! :D  

Thank you so much for Professor Patrick and TAs's work! Cannot reach the goal without your help!
