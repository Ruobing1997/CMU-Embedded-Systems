## Overview
In this lab, we provide three modes that can be switched by simply clicking the button on the board.

### Three Modes
1. Party Mode
   1. In the mode, the user can expect to see the visualizer that can give us different colors by sound frequency, like voice.
2. Color Tuner Mode
   1. In this mode, the user can change the RGB color value using w or s on the keyboard, and with a or d, he can change brightness.
3. Flashy LEDs
   1. In this mode, the user can change the frequency between the Red and Blue light on the board by clicking buttons u or j. We also provide buttons with h or k for a shorter stride for you to tune.
